## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Setup Environment
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your private key
# PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Compile Contract
```bash
npm run compile
```

### Step 4: Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```

Expected output: All 30+ tests should pass ✅

### Step 5: Deploy to Testnet
```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Deploy Payroll contract to Core Testnet
- Show contract address (save this to .env as CONTRACT_ADDRESS)
- Display deployer address and balance

### Step 6: Fund the Contract
After deployment, send test ETH to the contract:
```javascript
// Using MetaMask or ethers.js
await signer.sendTransaction({
  to: 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS',
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther('5.0')
});
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Review the README.md** for complete documentation
2. **Test locally** using Hardhat network
3. **Deploy to testnet** and verify functionality
4. **Build frontend** (React.js) to interact with contract
5. **Consider security audit** before mainnet deployment

## 🔐 Security Reminders

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:**
- Never commit your `.env` file
- Never share your private key
- Always test on testnet first
- Use hardware wallet for mainnet
- Conduct security audit before production

## 🌐 Network Configuration

Currently configured for **Core Testnet**:
- RPC URL: https://rpc.test2.btcs.network
- Chain ID: 1114

To change networks, edit `hardhat.config.js`
